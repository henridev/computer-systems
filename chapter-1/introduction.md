# 1. introduction

- **computer**
  - multifunctional 
  - programmable
  - digital = we can work with discrete values 0 / 1
  - electronic = device works on electrical charge 
- **embedded system** = computer which is part of a device in order to enchance its functionality
- **digital electics**
  - electronics = technologie using electrical signals to process energy || information\
  - digital = using discrete values 
  - binary = digital values can only take up one or zero



types of electronics : 
- digital (processes information on a digital / binary basis)
- analog (prosseses infromation on an analog basis)
- vermogen (processes energy and vermogen instead of information)

analog vs digital :

> digital can take up only one of two values while for analog every current between two limits has a value (non discrete) 
> eg. analog 0 to 10V means 0V 0% of the max and 2,34V 23,4% of the max
> eg. digital certain electrical charges will represent one value in binary let's say a charge lower than 0.8v gives a 0 and a charge above 2v gives 1. values between them should be avoided as they won't provide a clear 0 or 1. 

## advantages electronics 

- **quality** 
  - signals can be strongly disrupted as long as differences between 0 and 1 can be distinguished. like we saw upper margin for 0 value is 0.8v so if we pass 0v we will also get 0 as long as we don't pass the threshold. 
  - choice, we can choose the quality of the digital information ourselves but it comes with a trade-off of requiring higher storage capacity 
  - variety, on one device information quality can vary
- **production cost**, digital electronics are favourable for miniaturisation
- **same hardware** for different types of information (audio / video / text ...)
- **Redundany, encryption, compression**
  - redundancy, extra bits are added to prevent file corruption. 
  - compression, the opposite of redundancy. we remove partialy or fully redundacy information not because it is pointless information but to save storage space
- **reliability** 
- **portability** = electronics are thanks to miniaturisation small and portable 


## computer types 

- **digital**
- **mechanic**
- **optical** = use photons to process infotrmation instead of elektrons 
  - computations are performed using light signals produced by lasers or diodes
  - pro : higher bandwidth / faster / less heath / less energy
  - con : not all electronic components can be converted to optical technology 
- **kwantum** = use quantum particles to perform calculations 
  - memory consists off **qubits**, which holds the values 0 and 1 at the same time it thus has the value of 2 bits.
  - **parallel computing**, computations won't only be performed faster but also in parallel instead of sequential 
  - con : needs extreme cooling / is currently unstable / algorithms need to be adapted to be performed in parallel instead of serial
